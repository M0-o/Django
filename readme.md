# Portfolio Builder Website

## Idea
Build a website that allows users to easily create a personalized portfolio.

## Workflow
1. **User Login**  
   - User logs in. If no account exists, the user must create one.
2. **Template Selection**  
   - User selects a portfolio template.
3. **Form Completion**  
   - User fills out a form with all required information (including photos of self and projects). (Note: File uploads vs direct links are yet to be decided.)
4. **Result**  
   - Display a preview of the generated portfolio or offer the website download, allowing the user to keep or discard it.

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify suitable single-page portfolio templates.
2. Implement authentication/authorisation logic .
3. Develop the base form.
4. Write backend logic to process the form data and populate the portfolio template.
5. Determine the delivery method for the generated files.
